description = '<p>The Spatial Aquatic Model (SAM) is an exposure model d' \
              'esigned to simulate the magnitude, duration, and location ' \
              'of aquatic exposure concentrations of pesticides. Pesticide ' \
              'concentrations are estimated as a function of chemical properties, ' \
              'environmental factors, and crop/management practices. Outputs include ' \
              'pesticide exposure concentrations in a receiving water body at ' \
              'the watershed or basin level. Concentrations also can be compared to ' \
              'user-defined toxicity thresholds in output tables, maps, and summary ' \
              'histograms to characterize the duration, frequency, and location of ' \
              'exceedances.</p>' \
              '<p>SAM incorporates spatial heterogeneity of assessed drainage ' \
              'areas (soils, land cover, weather), instead of assuming a single, ' \
              'uniform watershed for high-end/protective exposures, as in previous ' \
              'regulatory models. Exposure concentrations are not limited to the ' \
              'standard farm pond or index reservoir, but represent actual water ' \
              'bodies within and across use areas. Output concentrations are ' \
              'aggregated at the outlet of each drainage basin (drinking water ' \
              'basin or HUC12 catchment). For ecological assessments, exposure ' \
              'estimates are based on the main channel within the HUC12. Drinking ' \
              'water exposure estimates are binned as static (lakes, reservoirs) ' \
              'or flowing (streams, rivers) water bodies.</p>' \
              '<p>Due to the national scale of this model, instead of routing ' \
              'flow from fields to stream channels to larger streams, flow is ' \
              'accumulated at the outlet (\"pour point\")  for the catchment of ' \
              'interest (HUC12 or drinking water basin). Daily flow estimates can ' \
              'be compared to stream gauge measurements and daily concentrations to ' \
              'monitoring datasets.</p>' \
              '<p>This is the alpha version of SAM.  Important routines including ' \
              'erosion, spray drift, irrigation, travel times beyond a \"dayshed\", ' \
              'and the application window (as a function of weather and crop stage) are ' \
              'in development.</p>' \

              '<p> Recipe files are used to create a list of soil-crop-weather units in each ' \
              'basin and the total area of each unit to be simulated. The one-dimensional solute ' \
              'transport routines in SAM are based on PRZM, but are structured differently ' \
              'by separating hydrology and chemical transport to reduce redundancy and increase ' \
              'computational speed. The approach consists of: Scenario Generator, which outputs ' \
              'the hydrology for sub watersheds using the curve number method (to estimate ' \
              'direct runoff and infiltration from rainfall events); Super PRZM Hydro, which ' \
              'sums the runoff (from all soil-crop-weather units) to represent the total ' \
              'daily runoff of an entire watershed; and Pesticide Transport and Water Body ' \
              'Concentration Calculator, which outputs the daily pesticide concentration in ' \
              'the receiving water body based on the transport, degradation, and washout of the ' \
              'pesticide mass.</p>'
