description = '<p>The Bee-REX model is a screening level tool that is intended for use in ' \
              'a Tier I risk assessment to assess exposures of bees to pesticides and to calculate ' \
              'risk quotients. This model is individual-based, and is not intended to assess exposures ' \
              'and effects at the colony-level (<i>i.e.,</i> for honeybees).</p>' \
              '<p>The Tier I exposure method is intended to account for the major routes of pesticide ' \
              'exposure that are relevant to bees (<i>i.e.,</i> through diet and contact). Exposure routes ' \
              'for bees differ based on application type. In the model, bees foraging in fields treated ' \
              'with a pesticide through foliar spray could potentially be exposed to the pesticide through ' \
              'direct spray as well through consuming contaminated food. For honeybees foraging in fields ' \
              'treated with a pesticide through direct application to soil (<i>e.g.,</i> drip irrigation), ' \
              'through seed treatments, or through tree injection, direct spray onto bees is not expected. ' \
              'For these application methods, pesticide exposure through consumption of residues in ' \
              'nectar and pollen are expected to be the dominant routes. Foraging honeybees may also be ' \
              'exposed to pesticides via contact with dust from seed treatments or via consumption of ' \
              'water from surface water, puddles, dew droplet formation on leaves and guttation fluid; ' \
              'however, the Bee-REX tool does not include quantification of exposures via these routes.</p>'
